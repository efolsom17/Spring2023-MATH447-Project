#Spring2023-MATH447-Project
Spring 2023 Math 447 Project. A place to share our code/work that we have done on the project.

Please read the first paragraph of the R markdown file. I will do my best to explain the best way for us to use this resource for improving the workflow in person. Just ask if you have any questions that weren't answered. Feel free to add whatever you have that you think would be helpful for this project.

You can view the Rmarkdown file my clicking on it and edit it by clicking on the pencil/pen (whatever the you decide it is, idk you have the free will do decide what it is), to edit the code. Also please check out the "Projects" tab to see my basic af outline of the project, make changes to it as you wish. There is a discussion page where we can share datasets. I would prefer that we use data which we can use an R package/python to scrape the data (that would look good on a resume I think, idk might be very wrong on that) as our dataset.
