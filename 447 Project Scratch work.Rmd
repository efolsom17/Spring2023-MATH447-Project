Informative Project title: Predicting the Popularity of Different Beers

The team Name: Stout-asticians

Research Goal (with short description): The goal of this project is to predict the future popularity of beers given certain factors. We will be analyzing a dataset to determine which keywords, type, brand, aroma, style, apperance, taste and so forth affect what beers people prefer. Using this will we create predictions on beer popularity.

# Notes from talking with Kimi

We are gonna treat our data as continous, Try to do classification on the names of the beer. We can do k-nearest neighbors, might be useful. We can use methods from chapter 8.

Sorry took a while for me to commit this, if anyone has any more notes from our meeting on tuesday please include them
